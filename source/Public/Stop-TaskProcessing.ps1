<#
.SYNOPSIS
Stops the processing of the script when called within the Start-LCM function.

.DESCRIPTION

#>
Function Stop-TaskProcessing {
    # Check to make sure that Stop-TaskProcessing is being called within Start-LCM
    # Get the call-stack
    $callStack = Get-PSCallStack
    if ($callStack.Command -notcontains 'Start-LCM') {
        Write-Error "[azdo-dsc-lcm\Stop-TaskProcessing] Stop-TaskProcessing can only be called within the Start-LCM function."
        return
